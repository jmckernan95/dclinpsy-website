## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**404 Error on Refresh**
- This is normal for GitHub Pages with BrowserRouter
- Users should navigate using the app's internal links
- Direct URL access works for the homepage

**Deployment Not Updating**
```bash
# Force rebuild and deploy
rm -rf build
npm run deploy
```

**Build Warnings**
- ESLint warnings don't affect functionality
- Address them for cleaner code but not required for deployment

### Build Cache Issues
```bash
# Clear npm cache
npm start -- --reset-cache

# Clear build directory
rm -rf build node_modules
npm install
npm run deploy
```

### Checking Deployment Status
- Visit [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/jmckernan95/dclinpsy-website)
- Check "Actions" tab for deployment history
- "Pages build and deployment" workflow shows status

---

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- No sensitive data in repository
- User passwords encrypted with PBKDF2
- Age verification data encrypted locally
- All data stays on user's device

### Public Repository
- Repository is public (required for GitHub Pages)
- No API keys or secrets in code
- No user data transmitted externally
- Safe for public hosting

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- **Cloud Sync**: Add user account synchronization across devices
- **Analytics**: Track usage patterns (anonymously)
- **Content Management**: Admin interface for adding questions
- **Export Features**: PDF reports of progress
- **Mobile App**: React Native version

### Development Setup
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/jmckernan95/dclinpsy-website.git
cd dclinpsy-website

# Install dependencies
