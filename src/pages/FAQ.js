        id: 'what-is-dclinpsy',
        question: 'What is DClinPsy and why do I need to prepare?',
        answer: `DClinPsy stands for Doctorate in Clinical Psychology. It's a highly competitive 3-year professional doctorate program that trains you to become a qualified clinical psychologist in the UK. 

        With acceptance rates typically below 10%, thorough preparation is essential. Our platform helps you practice the key skills and knowledge areas commonly assessed in DClinPsy applications, including Situational Judgment Tests, statistical knowledge, and professional understanding.`
      },

      },
      {
        id: 'do-i-need-account',
        question: 'Do I need to create an account to use the platform?',
        answer: `No, you don't need an account for basic usage. You can practice SJT tests and access most content anonymously.

        However, creating a free account provides additional benefits:
        ‚Ä¢ Progress tracking across all practice sessions
        ‚Ä¢ Personalized study recommendations
        ‚Ä¢ Category-specific performance analytics
        ‚Ä¢ Test history and trend analysis
        ‚Ä¢ Optional research participation opportunities`
      },
      {
        id: 'official-endorsement',
        question: 'Is this platform officially endorsed by BPS or universities?',
        answer: `This platform is an independent educational resource created by clinical psychology professionals. While not officially endorsed by BPS or universities, all content is carefully aligned with BPS and HCPC professional standards.

        This tool supplements, but does not replace, formal DClinPsy preparation programs. Always refer to official BPS and HCPC guidelines for authoritative information.`

    ],
    sjt: [
      {
        id: 'what-is-sjt',
        question: 'What exactly is a Situational Judgment Test (SJT)?',
        answer: `An SJT is an assessment that presents realistic professional scenarios and asks you to rank response options from most to least appropriate. In clinical psychology, SJTs assess:

        ‚Ä¢ Clinical reasoning and professional judgment
        ‚Ä¢ Understanding of ethical principles
        ‚Ä¢ Knowledge of professional boundaries
        ‚Ä¢ Risk assessment capabilities
        ‚Ä¢ Cultural competence and inclusive practice

        You'll see a clinical scenario followed by 5 response options that you must rank in order of appropriateness.`
      },
      {
        id: 'sjt-scoring',
        question: 'How does the proximity-based scoring system work?',
        answer: `Our scoring system rewards clinical reasoning even when your ranking isn't perfect:

        ‚Ä¢ Exact match: 4 points
        ‚Ä¢ ¬±1 position off: 3 points  
        ‚Ä¢ ¬±2 positions off: 2 points
        ‚Ä¢ ¬±3 positions off: 1 point
        ‚Ä¢ ¬±4 positions off: 0 points

        Each question is worth 20 points maximum (5 answers √ó 4 points each). This system recognizes that clinical judgment often involves nuanced decisions where multiple approaches may be reasonable.`
      },
      {
        id: 'question-randomization',
        question: 'Why are answer options in different orders each time?',
        answer: `We randomize the order of response options to ensure authentic assessment of your clinical judgment rather than pattern recognition. This means:

        ‚Ä¢ You can't memorize answer positions
        ‚Ä¢ Each test session is genuinely challenging
        ‚Ä¢ You must engage with the clinical reasoning behind each option
        ‚Ä¢ The assessment more accurately reflects real-world decision-making

        The scoring system automatically accounts for this randomization.`
      },
      {
        id: 'category-mixing',
        question: 'What is category mixing and why is it important?',
        answer: `Category mixing ensures each practice test includes questions from multiple clinical domains rather than focusing on just one area. This approach:

        ‚Ä¢ Mirrors real DClinPsy assessments which cover diverse scenarios
        ‚Ä¢ Helps identify strengths and weaknesses across all domains
        ‚Ä¢ Provides balanced practice for comprehensive preparation
        ‚Ä¢ Prevents over-specialization in specific areas

        You can also choose to focus on specific categories if you want targeted practice in particular domains.`
      },
      {
        id: 'feedback-explanations',
        question: 'How detailed is the feedback after each question?',
        answer: `Each question provides comprehensive feedback including:

        ‚Ä¢ Detailed explanation for each response option
        ‚Ä¢ References to relevant BPS/HCPC guidelines
        ‚Ä¢ Clinical reasoning behind the ranking
        ‚Ä¢ Professional standards and ethical considerations
        ‚Ä¢ Learning points for future scenarios

        Feedback is organized by appropriateness ranking (most to least appropriate) to enhance learning and understanding of professional judgment.`
      }
    ],
    statistics: [
      {
        id: 'statistics-importance',
        question: 'Why is statistics knowledge important for DClinPsy?',
        answer: `Statistics knowledge is crucial for clinical psychology because:

        ‚Ä¢ DClinPsy programs require strong research skills
        ‚Ä¢ You'll need to understand and conduct research during training
        ‚Ä¢ Evidence-based practice relies on statistical literacy
        ‚Ä¢ Many DClinPsy applications include statistics assessments
        ‚Ä¢ Professional practice involves interpreting research findings

        Our statistics module covers essential concepts from descriptive statistics to advanced inferential methods.`
      },
      {
        id: 'statistics-level',
        question: 'What level of statistics knowledge do I need?',
        answer: `Our statistics module covers undergraduate to early postgraduate level concepts including:

        ‚Ä¢ Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation)
        ‚Ä¢ Probability and distributions  
        ‚Ä¢ Hypothesis testing and p-values
        ‚Ä¢ Correlation and regression
        ‚Ä¢ ANOVA and non-parametric tests
        ‚Ä¢ Effect sizes and confidence intervals
        ‚Ä¢ Basic research design principles
